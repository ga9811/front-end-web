    <h2>The Basic Stick</h2>
    <p>The Basic Stick is the perfect stick for beginners. The stick rotates slowly to provide <br/>
    extra time for performing stick tricks, but is flashy enough to impress your friends. <br/>
    Enjoy the following: </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Patented Dura-Coat <sup>&reg; </sup></strong> finish ensures sticks can withstand all weather conditions. 
            More durable than other sticks, these props will keep looking like new for as long as you own them.</p>
        <p><strong>Enhanced stick flexibility</strong> provides more bounce, allowing for better tricks. A soft rubber core adds a 
            whole new element to the sticking experience that you have to feel to believe!</p>
            <p><strong>Full customization</strong> will give you the chance to own a pair of sticks unlike any others out there. I make exactly
                what you want, with your colors and your designs.</p>    
        <p><strong>A personal touch</strong> through both my customization options and hand crafted design.</p>
